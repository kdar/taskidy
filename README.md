# Taskidy

Taskidy is a task runner written in bash. It's a replacement for what I generally use `make` for nowadays.

cd "$( dirname "${BASH_SOURCE[0]}" )" || exit

#+ description
task:hello() {  
  echo "YAY!" "$@"
}

#- the default task
#+ The task that is execute if no task is
#+ provided on the CLI.
task:default() {
  echo "default" "$@"
}
```

./run hello
```
